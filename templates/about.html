    <h1 class="text-center">About</h1>
    <p class="text-center">A cryptocurrency price tracker monitors the current value of different digital currencies and tokens. Many of these services provide historical data as well, allowing users to compare current prices against older values.</p>

    <p class="text-center">While it may seem obvious, the accuracy of the price tracker that an investor decides to use will have a significant impact on their decisions, as well as on the timing and success of their investments. A tracker that is updated consistently and that uses reliable data in calculating its values is obviously crucial.</p>

    <p class="text-center">However, there are many other considerations to keep in mind when selecting a cryptocurrency price tracker, including the ease of customer use, the range of digital currencies and tokens covered, and the suite of extra tools and information available.</p>
